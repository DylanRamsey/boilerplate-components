# Boilerplate's Goals

1. Provide a consistent starting point for front-end development
2. Save time by providing 'boilerplate' solutions to common problems
3. Encourage best practices through examples.


## Provide a Consistent Starting Point

Boilerplate povides

* conventions for naming, structure, and organization of front-end code,
* a consistent build process,
* a consistent pattern library, and
* good solutions of common components.

Most projects will need all of these and the tools and languages we use are unopinionated. Boilerplate pairs a selection of libraries with a selection of methodologies and conventions so that jump right into functionality and not re-visit conventions.


## Boilerplate Solutions to Common Problems

Boilerplate includes

* Commonly needed components based on our previous projects;
* Recommendations for approaches to areas like colors, shadows, and transitions; and
* Examples of Vue components that we vet against WCAG.

The code in Boilerplate is added directly to your project because its meant to be read, modified, and repurposed. While some of these components maybe good enough out of the box, most you'll need to do the last 10% to adapt them to your needs.


## Best Practices through Examples

All the code within Boilerplate should demonstrate best practices and complete examples of what we could use on a live website. By providing a complete example, it helps ensure that when we inevitably customize or extend them, we remember to include all the details needed for a live site.
