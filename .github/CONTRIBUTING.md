## Creating Pull Requests

Fork off of the appropriate branch:

* For work on the current, stable version of Boilerplate Components, fork off of `master`.
* For work on the upcoming or beta version of Boilerplate Components, fork off of `next`.

Submit a pull request and describe what your code is meant to do and why it should be included in Boilerplate Components; even better if you can reference articles or reasons for the change.


## Follow Code Conventions

Boilerplate Components follows [its own conventions](https://imarc-boilerplate.netlify.app/pattern-library/docs/abem.html) as closely as it can; make sure any code you submit does too. If there's areas you're not sure, fallback to Vue style guidelines and ABEM or BEM conventions, or [Imarc's Handbook.](https://handbook.imarc.com/)


## Versioning

The project loosely follows Semver - however defining what counts as a backwards-incompatible change in a front-end framework is somewhat ambiguous and left to the team's judgement.
